## Notes

- This extension should be compatible with any Firefox / Chromium based browser.
- This extension was inspired by **[Unnecessary Inventions][UI YouTube]** and his **[Website][UI Website]**.
- This extension is unofficial and not affiliated with MrBeast or YouTube.

## Making your own

Want to customize this extension with a different YouTuber or personality? Here's how:

1. **Fork this repository** and or clone it to your local machine
2. **Replace the images**: 
   - Replace the images in the `images/` folder with your own (numbered sequentially: `1.png`, `2.png`, `3.png`, etc. Leave no gaps in the numbering.) You can use websites such as [Photoroom](https://www.photoroom.com/tools/background-remover) to remove the background of your images, and websites like [compresspng](https://compresspng.com/) to compress your images.
   - Update `icon.png` with your own icon
3. **Update the manifest**:
   - Edit `manifest.json` and `manifest v3.json` to change the extension name, version number and description
4. **Handle text images** (optional):
   - If any images contain text that shouldn't be flipped, add them to `images/flip_blacklist.json`
   - Create alternative flipped versions in `images/textFlipped/` if needed
   - If you have no use for the flip blacklist, you should delete the `flip_blacklist.json` file.
5. **Test locally**: Load the extension in developer mode in your preferred browser. This is important. Do not upload broken extensions!
6. **Build the extension**: If you have 7-Zip installed, run `build.bat` to build the extension. This will create a zip file in the root directory of the repository. (The 7-Zip dependency is unfortunately required because Windows' built in Compress-Archive feature is completely busted for some reason). If packing manually, only include `images/`, `manifest.json`, `icon.png`, `settings.html`, `settings.js` and `mrbeastify.js`. When packing for Chrome, use the `manifest v3.json` file, but rename it to `manifest.json`.
7. **Upload to extension stores**: You can upload your customized version to Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, etc.

## Microsoft Edge <a id="microsoftedge"></a>

Microsoft Edge support has been ended, and the extension has been delisted. This is because Edge is consistently the slowest at reviewing extensions, constantly rejects my submissions with vague reasons why, and are all-round terrible. Download the Chrome version instead.
